This file contains stuff I think we need to provide in the genom3 library for the BIP Engine.

DONE - permament actvity global for BIPE to grab.
DONE - we need to make sure that the "ONE" slot we have for an activity in the control task is enough (unlikely).
control task now has an activity table (with 16 elements).

- we need to clarify the whole h2initglob, taskFromThread(tname)... according to Anthony, h2initGlob should 
  always be the first call, and it covers the main thread, but it is not even clear if the event port thread 
  is not created before they call us... Need to check with Jacques.
