This file contains stuff we need to address to properly work with the BIP Engine.

(Fixed) - reinstall kill in the BIP model... so we can quit properly.
- why is it that kill, abort and connect_service are not "defined"
  (the later, ok, but the 2 first are useful), this is be the case in
  both template (ROS and PocoLibs), so is this an optimization of the
  model, or there is a justification for this.


- I realize that WCET for system control rqsts cannot be given in the
  .gen model... another good reason to have these outside the .gen
